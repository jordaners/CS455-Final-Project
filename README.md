# CS455-Final-Project
AI Pacman Search Project

This project requires Python 2.7.16 to be run.  Many of the functions require python 2 to be the default language in order to properly run.  Python 2.7.16 can be downloaded at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

One of the required folders is unable to be copied over to github for some reason.  It is the "test_cases" folder given from the project author.  This folder is likely necessary to utilize the autograder file for the project.  If you would like to download the folder needed, it can be found at http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html.
